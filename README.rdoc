== Project Milkman

An Arduino project that measures your apartment’s milk consumption over time (you know, for mom), allows you to check how much milk is left while on the go, and even texts you if you’re close running low.

* Have roommates who forget to buy milk?
* Mom can check online and make sure you're drinking your milk!
